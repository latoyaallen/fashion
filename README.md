# Background
Our social media profiles say:
**_Stream the best fashion videos by Black Content Creators._**
Peach House currently does this.  Eventually, we want to include more than just fashion content creators.  We want to expand to a lifestyle brand.  This means our top level categories will be:

- Fashion
- Beauty
- Lifestyle



# November/December/January : Fashion

- For the first 3 months, we'll work on curating fashion content to share with our users.
- Instagram: Make 1 evening post.  Each post should hi light a woman whose video currently exists in the platform.
- Twitter: Make 2 evening posts.  One is a repost from IG, another is a mood board.

# Feb/Mar/April : Beauty

- Curate beauty content to share with our users.
- Instagram: Make 2 evening posts.  Each post should hi light a woman whose video currently exists in the platform; one from each category
- Twitter: Make 3 evening posts.  Two are reposts from IG, another is a mood board.

# May/June/July : Lifestyle

- Curate lifestyle content to share with our users.
- Instagram: Make 3 evening posts.  Each post should hi light a woman whose video currently exists in the platform; one from each category
- Twitter: Make 3 evening posts.  Two are reposts from IG, another is a mood board or thread.
